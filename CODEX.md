# CODEX

## Project Context
- Repo currently contains only a high-level `README.md` and no runnable app/workflow files.

## Working Guidance
- Keep edits minimal and grounded in existing repo files.
- Add TODO notes instead of inventing commands or workflows that are not present.

## TODO
- Add setup, run, and test commands when those files/scripts are introduced.
